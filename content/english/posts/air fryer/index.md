chapatti - soft dough

#### Dough Recipe

half cup water to one and quarter cup flour.
Knead for 1 minute only in mixer
else use hands
Dont screw up with gluten consitency
2 cups wheat : 3/4 cup water

tawa could be at 205-345 degree C

slow cooking - develop the crust overtime

For airfryer/ baking use **Pastry** dough rather than Indian dough

ice cold water to water butter cold in pastry mixture

* Vegan custard sauce recipe
  * cornstarch + vegan milk + maple syrup
* Cauliflower manchurian

self rising flour
  {{<def>}}
    Regular flour + baking powder + salt
  {{<def>}}


## Problems

Drying out before they are cooked.
    use high heat

Denser the vegitables, smaller the cuts

above 250 is roasting, anything below that is baking

#### Basil pesto

* basil / Basilikum leaves
* Garlic
* Pine nuts
* Nutritional yeast / Nährhefe
* olve oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper


*What is **YEAST** ?*
Yeasts are eukaryotic single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom.

*How does yeast work ?*
yeast is a fungus that eats SUGAR and produces Co2 and Alcohol as waste.

{{< img "fermentation-chemical-equation.png" "Chemical Equation" >}}

*How* do we trap Co2 released by yeast?
Gluten - viscoelastic matrix
like bubble gum

*What is fermentation ?*
{{< img "Fermentation-definition.png" "Fermentation definition" >}}

kneading the dough develops Gluten

In cold water, the gluten chains are more able to "stretch out" ... Hot water makes the gluten molecules form more of a "ball" shape

Cooking chickpeas the scientific way
    chickpeas are dry from inside
    add tea bag and baking soda at the same time

#### baking powder vs baking soda vs yeast
"Baking powder is baking soda mixed with a few extra ingredients, including an acid. When you're baking a recipe that doesn't call for any acids, baking powder provides the rising power of baking soda and takes care of the chemistry part for you. Baking powder is only fully activated by heat, which is why a cake rises in the oven and not on your countertop, the way bread does.

For cakes, muffins, pancakes, or any other baked goods that go straight into the oven without rising, baking soda or baking powder are the way to go. Baking soda (scientific name: sodium bicarbonate) also creates carbon dioxide, and although it doesn't need resting time to start working, it does need acid. Baking soda is great for recipes that have built-in acidic elements, like lemon or buttermilk — without them, baking soda leaves behind a distinctive taste.
