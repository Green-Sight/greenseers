    it is the illusion of knowledge.

How do we learn?
start from the most fundamental truth and then work your way up from there.

The less we eat, the more we live. Studies done on insects, animals except
human beings.

**AGING** cumulative damage to DNA.
Sirtuin proteins can help in longetivity. Responsible for DNA repair
Fasting is good

# Food choices

### Whats the best diet for humans?
Just like cats, dogs and any other mammal, there is a best diet for humans. For humans its one one which is **plant based** and almost all calories coming from 4 principle *food groups*

1. Fruits
2. Vegitables
3. Whole grains
4. Legumes

low in **fat** high in **fibre**

As the numbre of queens and kings and priests and priesteses have increased in the world, so is the heart diseases.

{{<quote author="Dr. Micheal Greger">}}
    Its almost impossible to design a protein deficient diet.

All the animals we eat for proteins are *Vegitarians*. Where is the logic in that!

Apart from promoting muscle growth and immunity functions, excess of proteins also lead to *high blood pressure*

Is some type of meat like white meat better tha other type like *redmeat* ?
Stop and think for a second, what is meat? They are muscles and organs of animals. They all are the same

- high fat
- high protein
- high cholestrol
- high in **Food Chain**
- No food fibre

What about **Calcium**? Should not dairy products be calcium rich?
{{<info>}}
    Small Orange has ~40 milligrams of Calcium. <br>
    And we need 500-1200 mg per day.
{{</info>}}

Start with, What is **Milk**?
Cow millk is for baby-cows, not for adults of another species.
Its a cocktail of growth-hormones, lard and fat to fasten the growth of baby animal. Its similar to a **liquid meat**

Fatty Acids
Our body needs **Omega 3** and **Omega 6**, rest all fats could be synthesised by body from plant based foods.

Soures of Omega 3

- Walnuts
- Flax seeds
- Soy

Sources of Omega 6

- meat products
- Poly unsaturated vegitable oils

Ration between Omega3:Omega6 1:3. But its 1:25 based on normal american diet. Instead of bringing up Omega3 contents using suppliments, try reducing the Omega6 intake.

Why are there obese Vegitarians?
They haven't given up the **Vegitable oil**.

    Let the food be thy medicine,
    and thy medicine be thy Food.

All the nutrients that we need are in food. And they are present in very complex combinations that we do not understand fully yet. Suppliments extract a specific compund and overload it on the consumer.

Organic vs non-organic food ?

70% of the US arable land is used to grow crops for animals, and not humans.

    For animals all people are Nazis,
    to them life is eternal Treblinka.
{{</quote>}}

Carnism is a concept used in discussions of humanity's relation to other animals, defined as a prevailing ideology in which people support the use and consumption of animal products, especially meat.

When its not a necessity for survival, it become a choice
and choices always stem from believes.
